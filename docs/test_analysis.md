#### API: 
  - /getChannelsList
  - /deleteChannel
  - /formSubmit
  - /channelSubmit

#### LOAD TESTS:
  - `/getChannelsList`

##### Test analysis: 
Note: 
- To create latency test i needed to use result tree for others graph was enough.
- Files: getChannelsListGraph, getChannelsListTree
- Test succeeded
> throughput: 194.367/minute
> deviation: 7995
> latency: 27822
> sample time: 27824

  - `/deleteChannel`
